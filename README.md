Jackal Programming Language
===========================

Jackal is a programming language optimized for artificial intelligence. The goal of Jackal is to solve the issues of
automatically generating solutions.

Imperitive languages like C/C++ have syntax that is too complex to effectively create automated source code.

Jackal was inspired by a demonstration of automated program generation using the esoteric language "brainfuck" [1], we
aim to create a syntax that generated and interpreted with neural networks and similar machine learning methods.
